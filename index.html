									<h2><a href="https://github.com/singhPratapKavya">US Housing Rent Prediction<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>
										As international or domestic students, many students arrive from various locations and countries,
making it difficult for them to estimate the rent they must pay. Moreover, each student has
unique requirements and options. As a result, their calculations for budgeting and spending could
be challenging. Since housing is one of the most important basic requirements, I decided to do
an analysis that will be useful for the current students as well as future cohorts in determining the
proper rent price that is most suitable for them in order to attend the university. Each student has
a unique background and specific preference. The dataset includes
characteristics such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, furnished options, laundry, parking
options, pets allowed, smoking allowed or not, wheelchair accessibility, or even electric vehicle
charging capabilities. Using various Machine Learning algorithims I predicted type of apartment based on various features and predicted the price of a an apartment.

										<h2><a href="https://github.com/singhPratapKavya">Bike Rental Analysis<br />

									<p>
										Leaving in the city is a transportation challenge. With increasing number of cars and cumbersome traffic jams, citizens tend to look for alternatives. Healthy lifestyle and concern about ecology encourage more and more people to select bike as their mean of transport. It's an interesting task to explore what factors influence cyclists' decisions.

Thanks to the data shared by Capital Bikeshare company this kind of analysis is possible. The project will focus on understanding behavior of people renting bikes in Washington D.C. in years 2012-2018.

									<p>
										I used different ML techniques/algorithms to try to predict if a flight will be delayed or not 
										before it is even announced on the departure boards. Sills used are Python, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas

									<a href="https://github.com/singhPratapKavya" class="image fit"><img src="images/diabetes.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I built a system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning. This project is done in Python. In this project, I used Support Vector Machine model for the prediction
										and accuracy of 77% was achieved on test data.

									<a href="https://github.com/singhPratapKavya" class="image fit"><img src="images/covid.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										Using a dataset provided by the Indian Ministry of Health & Family Welfare I observed the Covid Trend Graph. In this project I will interpret and analyze the data for various factors such as testing details,number of cases and vaccines administered to make meaningful predictions such as potential emergencies, lockdowns and the rise in new cases.

									<p>Email spam detection system is used to detect email spam using Machine Learning technique called Natural Language Processing and Python, where we have a dataset contain a lot of emails by extract important words and then use naive classifier we can detect if this email is spam or not.
										Created a K-nearest Neighbors "KNN" model using scikit-learn and thin fit it to the data and accuracy of 100% was achieved on Binary Classification.</p>

										It is an ML-based approach to filtering or predicting the users’ film preferences based on their past choices and behavior. It’s an advanced filtration mechanism that predicts the possible movie choices of the concerned user and their preferences towards a domain-specific item, aka movie.
